# Rob's Music Shop

Rob's Music Shop is a basic website landing page created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

This landing page displays several sections one would commonly find in many modern websites such as header, hero, information, testimonial, and footer sections. The website's theme was based around the idea of an ecommerce music shop that sells music gear such as drums, guitars, keyboards, pianos, etc.

## Skills Applied

The main goal of this project was to follow a design and build a website landing page from scratch in order to apply what was taught in the [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations) and [Flexbox](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox) sections of the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.
